                Languages change as does the technology to help users experience the web, and I prioritize keeping up with the changes in accessibility.  Websites should be enjoyable for <em>all</em> users.

                My main set-up these days utilizes VSCode, Gimp, Canva and Figma. I also have experience with Adobe Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator.

                I am focusing on learning React Native to develop mobile apps, as well as the NextJS framework. I am open to freelance work or a front-end development position.
